Overview
Author: Moussa Taifi


This is a puppet project to create an mpi or hadoop-ready cluster out of virtual machines. The utilities are geared more specifically towards using an eucalyptus private cloud account. The puppet part of this project can be used for any virtual machine, be it private or public cloud. It provide basic capabilities for creating a shared nfs filesystem, user home directories, password-less key setup and basic HPC packages management (gcc, mpi,...).



Getting Started
Change to the utils directory and make sure that the euca2ools are working



Step 1 Initialization

start the instances
	python startinstances.py
wait for instances to start
	wait......:)
get the ips
	python getips.py
add the current public key to all the nodes
	python addpubkeytonodes.py
set the hostnames
	python sethostnames.py
send the hosts file
	python sendhostsfile.py
send the git key to the clusternode0
	python copygitkey.py
install puppetmaster on master and puppet on puppet clients
	python installpuppet.py
install git to the clusternode0, set up the git init and the remote git hub repo.
	python installgit.py
deploy initial config to clusternode0
	rake cleandeploydevelop or rake cleandeploy 
copy puppet conf to all the nodes and restart services
	python copypuppetconf.py
sign the certificates of the nodes
	python signcerts.py
	
	
Step 2 update commit deploy

deploy initial config to clusternode0
	rake deploy or rake deploydevelop
trigger apply to all nodes 
	python triggerapplyall.py	
	
	
	
Step 3 creating the beowulf cluster

add the necessary hpc software needed for the deployment under hpcfy / manifests / classes / hpcsoft.pp
